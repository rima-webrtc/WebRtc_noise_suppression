split the 48khz audio to three 16khz audios. then merge the three audios to one audio.

the old project cannot run well because he donnot update all the file from webrtc, and we donnot know the version of webrtc the files come from.

but you can get a lot useful information in the [old_readme_cn.md](./old_readme_cn.md) and [old_readme_md](./old_readme.md).
